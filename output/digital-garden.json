Most likely, yes. At the very least, people are familiar with his distinctive art style. Is that a negative thing? No, not at all.\n\nHe aimed for his art to be widely viewed, not limited to traditional art galleries, and to be accessible to everyone. He gained recognition by creating chalk doodles in subway stations, performing live painting in public areas, and painting murals in schools located in underprivileged neighborhoods. He also collaborated with AIDS activists.\n\nIt’s somewhat ironic that his rebellion against the elitist art world institutions has resulted in a large consumer market, where a lot of money is involved.\n\nIn addition to everything else, I really appreciate the aesthetic of his iconography style."

There’s something special about how she mixes those geometric shapes with so much dynamic in her pieces. I first saw her art at an exhibition in Basel, and it really stuck with me.  It’s cool how her art shows the creative spirit of the post-war era but still feels fresh and modern today!\n\nShe is one of the artists who inspires me to get back into creative coding. Her graphical style would be perfect for recreating algorithmically.\n\n\n## Exhibition\n\nSnapshots from my visit to the Shirley Jaffe exhibition in Basel on June 7, 2023\n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/daxsvl9cg/image/upload/f_auto/v1729331356/obsidian/ocwnfkc8shkzkjupxhc8.jpg)\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/daxsvl9cg/image/upload/f_auto/v1729331385/obsidian/nskanrdbmhf4o6fb8lcr.jpg)\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/daxsvl9cg/image/upload/f_auto/v1729331384/obsidian/kzkshzcnhjpigzsfakkb.jpg)"

But her work stands completely on its own and deserves way more recognition.\n\nWhat I find fascinating about her paintings is how she simplifies forms and uses bold, flat colors. There's a directness to her work that feels almost modern, even though she was painting over a hundred years ago. Her landscapes and portraits have this beautiful balance between abstraction and representation.\n\nShe was a key figure in founding Der Blaue Reiter alongside Kandinsky and Franz Marc, which was one of the most influential expressionist movements. After World War I and her separation from Kandinsky, she continued working but largely stepped away from the public art world.\n\nOne remarkable thing she did was hide and preserve a huge collection of avant-garde art during the Nazi era when such works were labeled \"degenerate art\". She later donated over 80 of her own works and many pieces from her collection to the Lenbachhaus in Munich, which now has one of the best collections of Blaue Reiter art in the world."

I even subscribed to a podcast on the subject, can you imagine?

Additionally, the writing style and the abrupt structure of the chapters didn’t draw me in. I still like the genre of historical fiction and the greek mythology, which made the book interesting enough for me to finish, but it didn’t capture my curiosity about this new world like «Circe» did.\n\t</div>\n</div>"

There are two main types of balance: symmetrical (even distribution) and asymmetrical (unbalanced distribution). The aim is to create a harmonious overall picture.\n\n## 2. contrast\nContrast involves emphasising differences between elements in the design. This can be achieved by using color, size, shape or texture to create visual interest and highlight important elements.\n\n## 3. emphasis\nThis principle focuses on emphasising a main element or message in the design. It draws the viewer's attention to the most important thing and helps to establish the hierarchy.\n\n## 4. movement\nMovement refers to the way in which the viewer's eye is guided through the design. This can be achieved through lines, direction, pattern or animation to create a visual flow.\n\n## 5. repetition\nRepetition involves using recurring elements such as colors, shapes or fonts to create consistency and coherence in the design. This helps to create a uniform appearance.\n\n## 6. hierarchy\nHierarchy defines how elements in the design are organized to show their importance and relationship to each other. This makes it possible to emphasize important information and create a clear structure.\n\n## 7. white space\nWhite space refers to the unused space in the design that remains between elements, text and graphics. It creates space and facilitates visual processing. Less can often be more.\n\n## 8. unity\nUnity means that all elements in the design fit together and form a coherent whole. This is achieved by applying the other principles to ensure that the design is cohesive and appealing."

The notes don’t have to be polished or finished; they can be shared as incomplete ideas that will develop over time and ideally create new connections, which may eventually lead to the development of a blog post or similar content to share fresh insights.\n\nI have decided to publish my digital garden, which I already maintain for myself locally in Obsidian, on my personal website, as one or the other note might be exciting for you and initiate new thoughts and ideas.\n\n\n## How did I build my digital garden?\n\nI use the software Obsidian to create, edit, and organize my notes, and it’s convenient because I can do this on both my smartphone and laptop. The app automatically adds important information like creation dates, editing dates, and footnotes, which makes it user-friendly. I wanted the process of creating and maintaining notes to be straightforward, without any technical challenges, so I would actually use it.\n\nMy Obsidian Vault syncs automatically with GitHub whenever I make changes. Each day, the latest version of my GitHub project is automatically fetched from my personal website and shown in this digital garden, so I don’t have to manually deploy my local changes.\n\n\n\n## Ideas (to implement)\n\n- [ ] add backlink logic to other notes\n- [ ] support for nested categories/folders\n- [ ] add handmade scribbles to notes\n- [ ] add \"random note\" feature for sidebar navigation\n- [ ] dynamic open graph images for notes and topics"

I am special!\" But the thing is, those statements are so general and vague that they could apply to almost anyone.\n\nThis is called the Barnum effect. It's when people take general statements as being specifically about them, even if they're not really true or specific.\n\n\n### How AI advice can trigger the Barnum Effect \n\nAs more and more AI apps enter the realm of personalised guidance, we're becoming more susceptible to the Barnum effect.\n\nWe accept generalised advice that applies to almost everyone else as personal observations. For example, you wrote an entry in one of those AI-powered journal apps, that you've been feeling demotivated at work lately.\n\nTrying to come up with personalised advice the journal app writes: _\"Your feelings of lost motivation may stem from a deep-seated need to make a significant impact in your field.\"_\n\nThis is the Barnum effect in full swing. While the statement is valid and relatable, the loss of motivation you feel right now might be different. You might just be burned out after an exhausting project, or the work itself doesn't excite you. Not understanding the root cause of our feelings and directing our energy into solving a vague problem will only cause further dissatisfaction."

I came across this concept because I often find myself reaching for my smartphone whenever I’m faced with difficult tasks, stress, or anxiety.\n\nThe idea behind urge surfing is that urges rise and fall like waves — and that you can learn to ride them without being overwhelmed.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n1. **Observe** the urge without judging or suppressing it. What do you feel in your body? What thoughts arise?\n2. **Acknowledge** the urge. It’s a normal part of human experience.\n3. **Surf** the urge like a wave: notice it building, peaking, and eventually fading.\n4. **Time** the urge. Most urges don’t last longer than 30 minutes if you don’t act on them.\n5. **Redirect** your focus. Engage in something else — like walking or listening to music — while the urge passes.\n\n**Important:**  \nUrge surfing is not about avoiding or suppressing urges. It’s about noticing and accepting them, which helps reduce their power over time."

Go for walks. Ride your bike going nowhere in particular. There is a creative purpose to daydreaming, even to boredom. The best ideas come to us when we stop actively trying to coax the muse into manifesting and let the fragments of experience float around our unconscious mind in order to click into new combinations. Without this essential stage of unconscious processing, the entire flow of the creative process is broken. Most important, sleep. Besides being the greatest creative aphrodisiac, sleep also affects our every waking moment, dictates our social rhythm, and even mediates our negative moods. Be as religious and disciplined about your sleep as you are about your work. We tend to wear our ability to get by on little sleep as some sort of badge of honor that validates our work ethic. But what it really is is a profound failure of self-respect and of priorities. What could possibly be more important than your health and your sanity, from which all else springs?

Spoiler: the children have eaten the chocolate.\n\nIt's funny that I'm now encountering this psychological effect again 13 years later in the form of the concept of \"delayed gratification\".\n\nDelayed gratification is the ability to resist the temptation for an immediate reward and wait for a later reward that is usually greater. It’s about being patient and making choices that might be harder now but will lead to better outcomes in the future.\n\nfirst read about the concept on Marcels Blog[^1]\n\n[^1]: https://marcel.io/posts/life-affirming-choices"

      "content": "Today, I came across the following thesis in Joan Westenberg’s newsletter[^1]: \nMcDonald’s discovered that customers who order through self-service kiosks make different choices than those ordering from a human cashier. Without social signals like eye contact or pauses in conversation, people tend to order more – for example, two burgers instead of one. The absence of social control from others leads to impulses being expressed more freely. This shows that digital interfaces are not only more convenient, but also strip away natural psychological barriers that would otherwise regulate our behavior. (Good news for McDonalds)\n\n## Social influences shape our decisions\n\nIn the real world, our decisions are often influenced by social signals. When interacting with others, we subconsciously pay attention to their reactions – a quick glance, a raised eyebrow, or a pause in conversation can make us reflect. These small cues help us regulate our behavior and reconsider impulsive decisions.\n\n## Decisions in digital environments without social control\n\nIn the digital space, direct social signals that make us reflect are absent. Without eye contact or reactions from others, we act more impulsively.\n\n- **Online shopping:** A single click, and the shopping cart fills with impulse purchases. No one is watching critically, so we think less.\n- **Online dating:** Without a real person in front of us, we swipe quickly, rather than taking time for a deeper connection. The person, with their complex social depth, disappears behind images that are superficially judged.\n- **Social media:** Without direct consequences, we post unfiltered opinions that we might hold back in a real conversation.\n\nDigital platforms make decisions easier – but often also more thoughtless (and this on purpose).\n\n[^1]: https://www.joanwestenberg.com/when-screens-remove-our-better-angels/"
